# ðŸ§  DSA & JavaScript Problem Solving â€“ Peyush Nuwal

This repository is where I document my journey to master **Data Structures, Algorithms**, and **core JavaScript**.

## ðŸ“Œ What This Repo Contains

- Solutions to DSA problems (mostly from LeetCode, NeetCode, and interview experiences)
- Focus on writing clean, readable, and optimized JavaScript code
- Thought process, brute-force to optimized transitions, and edge case handling
- Mistakes, re-attempts, and learnings from failed interviews
- Deep dive into how JavaScript handles data, functions, recursion, async, and more

## ðŸŽ¯ Why I'm Doing This

I realized that to become a **solid developer** â€” especially for frontend or full stack roles â€” it's not enough to just build UIs.  
I need to:
- Think clearly under pressure  
- Write performant code  
- Understand JavaScript inside-out  

This repo is my way of staying consistent, getting better every day, and turning weaknesses into strengths.

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack

- Language: JavaScript
- Environment: Node.js for quick CLI testing
- Tools: VS Code, Git, and raw determination

> This is not just about cracking interviews â€” itâ€™s about becoming the kind of developer who *canâ€™t be ignored*.
